## Hello my name is Kyryl and I am a young developer working on a lot of cool and innovative projects. I'm currently learning C++ to create some arduino projects and code some games with OpenGL. I'm currently working on a arduino car that can expand itself to cross gaps, I'm also working on a 2D platformer.
